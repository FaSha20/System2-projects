# RL Post-Training for Qwen2-0.5B

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning the Qwen2-0.5B model using supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a pre-trained model.
2. Post-training using RL objectives to further improve model performance.
3. Evaluation and visualization of results.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.11
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets
- PyTorch
- TensorBoard
- Other dependencies listed in the notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

## Key Features
- Supervised Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the Qwen2-0.5B model using labeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: Apply RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) to optimize the model further.
- Logging and Visualization: Use TensorBoard for monitoring training progress.
